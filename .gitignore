# Description: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
# Functionalities:
#   - Prevents sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) from being committed to the repository.
#   - Excludes build artifacts and temporary files from version control.
#   - Reduces the size of the repository by excluding unnecessary files.
# Choices and Reasons:
#   - .env: Excludes environment variable files, which often contain sensitive information.
#   - data/: Excludes the data directory, which may contain large datasets or other files that are not essential to the codebase.
#
# Additional Notes:
#   - This file should be placed in the root directory of the Git repository.
#   - Each line in the file specifies a pattern to be ignored.
#   - Patterns can include wildcards (e.g., *.log) and directory names.
